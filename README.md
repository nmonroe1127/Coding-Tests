# Coding-Tests
I tried to keep the execution of this executable fairly simplistic in nature
so that both Windows and Linux can run this program. 

All that is needed is to type: "py CodeTest" and it will start the program. 
The "py" part may be different on your computer, replace the "py" with 
whatever phrase you use to start up python in terminal. It will most likely be
"python" or whatever you are using as your path variable.

Or you can just double click the CodeTest1.py file. It should pull up terminal 
and allow you to play around with the program, but that is the boring way of doing things.
You will learn alot more with using terminal to find and start a python file then by
just double clicking the program in a file. 

## Runtime Prompt for the application. 
Enter P for Pangram Detector, A for Animation or E to exit: 
If you enter P it will send you to the 1st function within the code.
If you enter A it will send you to the 2nd function within the code. 
If you enter E it will exit the program for you. 

## What these applications do.
### Pangram Detector. 
The user will give a string for the program to check if it is a Pangram or not. A pangram is a sentence containing every letter in the English Alphabet. 
#### Example of this: 
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” is a Pangram because it contains all the characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’
"The quick brown fox jumps over the dog" is not a Pangram because it doesn’t contains all the characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’, as ‘l’, ‘z’, ‘y’ are missing.

The MakeFile is an unimportant documentation because this is a python implementation. 
It was only included to give the user experience on using MakeFile functionality.
