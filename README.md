# Coding-Tests
I wasn't sure if you guys were using Linux or Windows systems so I kept the
executable fairly simplistic in nature. All that is needed is to type:
"py CodeTest"
and it will start the program. 
The "py" part may be different on your computer, replace the "py" with 
whatever phrase you use to start up python in terminal.

Or you can just double click the CodeTest1.py file. It should pull up terminal 
and allow you to play around with the program.

You will be given a prompt
Enter P for Pangram Detector, A for Animation or E to exit: 
If you enter P it will send you to the 1st section of the code test.
If you enter A it will send you to the 2nd section of the code test. 
If you enter E it will exit the program for you.
