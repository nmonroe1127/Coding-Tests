I wasn't sure if you guys were using Linux or Windows systems so I kept the
executable fairly simplistic in nature. All that is needed is to type:
"py CodeTest"
and it will start the program. 
The "py" part may be different on your computer, replace the "py" with 
whatever phrase you use to start up python in terminal.

Or you can just double click the CodeTest1.py file. It should pull up terminal 
and allow you to play around with the program.

You will be given a prompt
Enter P for Pangram Detector, A for Animation or E to exit: 
If you enter P it will send you to the 1st section of the code test.
If you enter A it will send you to the 2nd section of the code test. 
If you enter E it will exit the program for you. 


@@@@@Refernce to the tools and technologies that Label Insight uses@@@@@
The Pangram Detector function to me represents the taking data from labels and processing
that information. The function is searching for letters present in the input string, while
your data label processing is looking for certain ingredients present in the product.
The Animation function represents the ability to look at a label and have a certain 
aspect of a product apply to multiple facets. For example: if a product is made with Non-GMO
wheat, then the data label process needs to be able to remember that it can say Non-GMO and
also say 100% whole wheat at the same time.
